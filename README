Use htpasswd/htgroup file as user database for Drupal 7.x.

INSTALLATION
------------
The drupal module name is 'htpasswd', so after checking out the source you have
to rename the directory to 'htpasswd'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
There's no fancy configuration from the admin interface, you rather have to
copy htpasswd.conf-dist to htpasswd.conf and change to your liking.

Defined groups in the htgroup-file can be mapped to drupal roles if defined in
the config file.
